# nihexporter

This package provides a minimal set of data from NIH EXPORTER
<http://exporter.nih.gov/default.aspx>, which contains information on NIH
biomedical research funding from 1985-2014 (and continues monthly in a given fiscal year).

The package contains the following tables:

* `projects`: provides data on funded projects by NIH.

* `publinks`: links Pubmed IDs (`pmid`) to project numbers (`project.num`)

## Data summary

There is a lot of data in NIH EXPORTER, so this package aims to provide a
minimal set of data without being too unwieldy. There are download and
import (`tidy_projects.R`) scripts in the `data-raw/` directory in the
package.

In the future, we might offer `project.pis` and `project.org` tables, to
see the who and where of NIH investment. See #1.
